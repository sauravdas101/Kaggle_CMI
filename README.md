CMI â€“ Detect Behavior from Sensor Data

This repository contains my work for the Kaggle CMI â€“ Detect Behavior from Sensor Data competition. The goal is to classify human/animal behaviors from multi-modal sensor time-series data.

ðŸ“Œ Competition Overview

Participants are tasked with predicting behavior classes from wearable or embedded sensor streams. The dataset contains multiple sensor channels (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, etc.) collected over time, and the objective is to design models that can effectively capture both temporal dependencies and physical motion patterns.
